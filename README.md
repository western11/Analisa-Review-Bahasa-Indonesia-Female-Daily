# Analisa-Review-Bahasa-Indonesia-Female-Daily
Analisa review pada 3 produk sunscreen di FemaleDaily.com bahasa Indonesia

This repo made especially for Lydia request for her thesis.
This NLP project contains topic modelling analysis (LDA) and predicting review based on user's text review in Indonesian languange (bahasa). All analysis use R languange. The predictoin are multi-label classification method because i considered the rating are non-ordinal.

You can see the result in mk2.html.

Right now i'm still looking for better model to predict the rating based on text data. This case actually an ordinal target vaiable where rating 5 > rating 1. it'll be better if the model can be builded using such necessities.

Thank you
